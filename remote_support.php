						<h2>We are safe & secure </h2>
						<p>Remote computer support is the fastest and least expensive method for fixing computer problems. Most computer problems can be resolved over the internet online using a remote computer connection. Computer garage computer techs can remote to your computer in less than 5 minutes to fix your computer problems. Besides being fast, remote computer help means that you are not waiting around for a technician to arrive and you don’t have to leave the comfort of your home or business. Remote computer support can also be used for other computer related issues such as software maintenance and upgrade, upgrading and installing new peripherals – printers, scanners and webcams. Remote computer help can also be used for one-on-one software training.</p>
						<p>In information technology (IT), remote support tools are IT tools and software that enable an IT technician or a support representative to connect to a remote computer from their consoles via the Internet and work directly on the remote system. Although its main focus is the access to computers located anywhere in the world, the remote support applications also provide features like file transfer, desktop sharing, file synchronization, command line or guest accessibility.</p>

							<h2>Privacy</h2>
							<span>We Provide</span>
							<p>Privacy is also a major concern for all users. One of the most used tools in remote support sessions are the ones that allow desktop sharing. It is also possible to provide what is commonly called Unattended Support (the technician is granted total remote access to the client’s computer, even when he is not physically close to it). The need for an absolute trust in these services and providers is considered to be the biggest obstacle for this technology to achieve mass-marketing status – even when many studies indicate that for every 5 technical occurrences, 4 of them could be remotely solved.</p>

							<h2>Benefits </h2>
							<span>We are for you</span>
							<p>Remote Support technology tries to reduce helpdesk centers cost-issues – all transport-related expenses are immediately trimmed down, for instance. Modern day technology enables that any technician using Remote Support is able to assist a customer just like it was physically side-by-side. Technologies and tools like live chat, VoIP and desktop sharing enable a direct intervention in the remote system.</p>
